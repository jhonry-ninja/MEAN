// Assignment: Debugging TypeScript and ES6

// Objectives:
    // • Recognize how to use TypeScript and ES6 to supercharge your JavaScript 

// TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It offers features above and beyond what JavaScript gives 
// us, which is useful while developing. For example, we can declare our data types, so if we 
// accidentally try to pass a string as an argument to a function that is expecting an array, 
// TypeScript will warn us that we're making a mistake. However, browsers understand JavaScript, not 
// TypeScript. Therefore, TypeScript gets transpiled to JavaScript. The Angular community decided 
// early on to adopt TypeScript as its main language of choice when writing Angular applications, 
// and that is what we use here. Use this assignment to get used to writing TypeScript before jumping 
// into Angular. However, keep in mind that TypeScript is optional and only offers benefits while 
// developing, not in the final product.

// Copy the code snippets into the TypeScript Playground tool. Identify the errors found in each code 
// snippet. You will see red bars in the Typescript side of the Playground where there is an error.
// • Fix the errors in the Playground so that all the red bars are gone and the code still runs as 
//   desired.
// • Make comments in the code to explain what each error was and how you fixed it.
// • For assignment submission, upload a ".ts" file with the contents of the TypeScript Playground.

// 1. Setting types
var myString: string;
// I can assign myString like this:
myString = "Bee stinger";
// Why is there a problem with this? What can I do to fix this?
myString = 9;
// Solution: myString  is a variable that should be assigned a string value, 
// yet it is assigned a number value:
myString = "Shitchyeah!"



// 2. Setting the types for function parameters
function sayHello(name: string){
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
// This is working great:
console.log(sayHello("Kermit"));
// Why isn't this working? I want it to return "Hello, 9!"
console.log(sayHello(9));
// Solution: the parameter of sayHello only accepts strings as an argument,
// 9 is a number, so it won't work
console.log(sayHello("...to my little friend"))



// 3. Optional parameters
function fullName(firstName: string, lastName: string, middleName: string){
    let fullName = `${firstName} ${middleName} ${lastName}`;
    return fullName;
}
// This works:
console.log(fullName("Mary", "Moore", "Tyler"));
// What do I do if someone doesn't have a middle name?
console.log(fullName("Jimbo", "Jones"));
// Solution: Add an if/else statement to check if the middleName exists or
// add a question mark to the middleName key.




// 4. Interfaces and function parameters
interface Student {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    belts: number;
}
function graduate(ninja: Student){
    return `Congratulations, ${ninja.firstName} ${ninja.lastName}, you earned ${ninja.belts} belts!`;
}
const christine = {
    firstName: "Christine",
    lastName: "Yang",
    belts: 2
}
const jay = {
    firstName: "Jay",
    lastName: "Patel",
    belt: 4
}
// This seems to work fine:
console.log(graduate(christine));
// This one has problems:
console.log(graduate(jay));
// Solution: const jay, listed "belt" as one of the keys when the interface 
// declares "belts" as one of the keys. 
It's missing the "s".



// 5. Classes and function parameters
class Ninja {
   fullName: string;
   constructor(
      public firstName: string,
      public lastName: string){
         this.fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
      }
   debug(){
      console.log("Console.log() is my friend.")
   }
}
// This is not making an instance of Ninja, for some reason:copy
const shane = Ninja();
// Since I'm having trouble making an instance of Ninja, I decided to do this:
const turing = {
   fullName: "Alan Turing",
   firstName: "Alan",
   lastName: "Turing"
}
// Now I'll make a study function, which is a lot like our graduate function from above:
function study(programmer: Ninja){
   return `Ready to whiteboard an algorithm, ${programmer.fullName}?`
}
// Now this has problems:
console.log(study(turing)
// Solution: the const "turing" is not an instance of Ninja.
// Change the shane function over to instantiate an instance of Ninja, 
// then change the parameter on function study works.


// 6. Arrow functions
var increment = x => x + 1;
// This works great:copy
console.log(increment(3));
var square = x => {x * x};
// This is not showing me what I want:
console.log(square(4));
// This is not working:
var multiply = x,y => x * y;
// Nor is this working:
var math = (x, y) => let sum = x + y;
    let product = x * y;
    let difference = Math.abs(x-y);
    return [sum, product, difference];
// Solution: Parenthesis and curly vrackets needed to be added.
// Also another pair of curly brackets need to be removed like so:
var increment = (x) => x + 1;
// This works great:
console.log(increment(3));
var square = (x) => x * x;
// This is not showing me what I want:
console.log(square(4));
// This is not working:
var multiply = (x,y) => x * y;
// Nor is this working:
var math = (x, y) => {  
   let sum = x + y;
   let product = x * y;
   let difference = Math.abs(x-y);
   return [sum, product, difference];
}


// 7. Arrow functions and 'this'
class Elephant {
    constructor(public age: number){}
    birthday = function(){
        this.age++;
    }
}
const babar = new Elephant(8);
setTimeout(babar.birthday, 1000)
setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(`Babar's age is ${babar.age}.`)
    }, 2000)
// Why didn't babar's age change? Fix this by using an arrow function in the Elephant class.
// Solution: const babar is a constant

// • Fix the code in the TypeScript playground
// • Comment your code to explain the errors and how you fixed them
// • Copy your code into a .ts file and submit
